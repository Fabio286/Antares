Antares is an SQL client based on [Electron.js](https://github.com/electron/electron) and [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) that aims to become a useful tool, especially for developers.  
My target is to support as many databases as possible, and all major operating systems, including the ARM versions.  

**At the moment this application is in development state, many features will come in future updates**, and supports only MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL.  
At the moment, however, there are all the features necessary to have a pleasant database management experience, so give it a chance and send us your feedback, we would really appreciate it.  
We are actively working on it, hoping to provide new cool features, improvements and fixes as soon as possible.  

üîó If you are curious to try Antares you can download and install the [latest release](https://github.com/Fabio286/antares/releases/latest).  
üëÅ To stay tuned for new releases [follow Antares SQL](https://twitter.com/AntaresSQL) on Twitter.  
üåü Don't forget to **leave a star** if you appreciate this project.

## Philosophy

Why are we developing an SQL client when there are a lot of them on the market?  
The main goal is to develop a totally free, full featured, cross platform and open source alternative, empowered by JavaScript's ecosystem.  
A modern application created with minimalism and semplicity in mind, with features in the right places, not hundreds of tiny buttons, nested tabs or submenu; productivity comes first.
